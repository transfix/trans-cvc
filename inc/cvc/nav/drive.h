// drive.h — the torch-free reactive vehicle drive for cvc::nav.
//
// The GRL-SNAM navigation kernels (grid_nav.h) are a bit-identical numpy port;
// this header begins the DRIVE port — the per-agent inference/integration that
// today runs in Python/torch (SDFField.sample -> CoefMLP -> bicycle_rollout ->
// the carrot FSM). It is deliberately libtorch-free so a pure-C++ host (a
// renderer / game engine) can run the swarm with no Python at all.
//
// Fidelity contract (see docs/CVCNAV_CPP_PORT_ROADMAP.md §1): the boundary is
// the bilinear sample. Everything upstream (belief -> occupancy -> EDT -> the
// built SDF field) stays BIT-identical to numpy; from the sample onward the
// contract relaxes to FLOAT-EQUIVALENT (<= ~1 ULP of the torch reference), which
// is validated by a fuzz test, never wired transparently into the torch path.
// Interior arithmetic is float32 to track torch's float32; this TU inherits the
// no -ffast-math / no -ffp-contract=fast discipline of the nav kernels, and the
// design is SoA + branch-light so a CUDA drive.cu can share the same math and
// the same .cvcnav weights.

// world via the field it holds (w = on/S + center). The written (fx, fy) is a
