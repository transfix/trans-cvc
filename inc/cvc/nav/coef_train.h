// coef_train.h — the SELF-SUPERVISED CoefMLP trainer, in pure C++, NO libtorch
// and NO Python (the training twin of the inference port). This is the port of
// grl_snam/tools/coef_train.py: there is no dataset and no labels — the gradient
// comes straight from a differentiable rollout over a scene's SDF ("did the
// agent reach its goal without hitting a wall") back into the coefficient net.
//
// The training rollout is the SIMPLE point-mass surrogate `sdf_rollout`
// (sdf_nav.py) — sample -> IPC wall force + goal spring + damping -> integrate —
// NOT the branch-heavy bicycle used at deployment, so the whole computation
// graph is small and smooth. Reverse-mode gradients are hand-written adjoints
// (the bilinear-sample position VJP, the MLP backward, the IPC-barrier
// derivative, and the rollout chain) and validated by a finite-difference
// gradcheck (nav_coef_train_test) — a torch-independent ground truth, so
// correctness never depends on matching torch's autograd bit-for-bit (it only
// has to descend the loss). Truncated BPTT (detach every `window` steps) bounds
// the graph, exactly as the Python trainer does.
//
// Trained weights export to the same versioned `.cvcnav` (coef_mlp::save) that
// torch, the CPU forward, and the CUDA forward all read — so a policy can be
// (re)trained on the deployment box with zero torch, then dropped into the
// pure-C++ swarm (sim_world / sim_world_cuda).
