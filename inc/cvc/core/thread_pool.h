// A persistent-worker thread pool for fork-join data parallelism.
//
// Spawning a fresh std::thread for every parallel region (the pattern in
// cvc::nav::detail::parallel_for's inline fallback) is fine once, but murder in
// a hot loop: a 60 Hz sim tick that fans out ~6 times pays thousands of thread
// creations per second AND floods every core, starving any concurrent thread
// (e.g. a render loop). This pool creates its workers ONCE and reuses them, so a
// parallel_for is just a wake + a barrier.
//
// It is a plain object with NO global/singleton instance: the owner (typically a
// cvc::app) constructs one and hands out a reference; callers that want to
// parallelize borrow that reference. This keeps the low-level compute kernels
// free of any global state — they parallelize through whatever pool they are
// given, or run inline when given none.
//
// parallel_for() is the single primitive. It runs fn(i) for i in [0, n) across
// the pool and blocks until every index is done. The CALLING thread participates
// (it is never idle waiting on the workers), and a shared atomic cursor hands out
// indices so uneven per-item cost self-balances. It is re-entrant: a parallel_for
// invoked from inside a pool task runs inline instead of deadlocking on workers
// that are busy with the outer job.
//
// parallel_for() is safe to call from any number of threads concurrently — the
// intended use for a shared pool like app::computePool(). The pool runs ONE
// fan-out at a time: concurrent orchestrators serialize, each later caller
// blocking until the in-flight job drains before its own is posted (they do not
// lend their thread to the in-flight job while they wait). Total throughput is
// bounded by the pool's workers either way; the serialization only adds latency
// when several threads fan out at once.
class thread_pool {
public:
  // Create `n_workers` background workers. 0 (the default) picks
  // hardware_concurrency() - 1, since the calling thread is itself a worker; a
  // pool with 0 workers is legal and runs everything inline on the caller.

  // Run fn(i) for each i in [0, n), returning only once all have completed.
  // `max_par` caps the TOTAL participants (including the caller) for this one
  // call; <= 0 means use the whole pool. A cheap, fine-grained region can pass a
  // small cap so it doesn't wake every worker. n <= 0 is a no-op.
  //
  // Exception safety: if one or more fn(i) throw, the fan-out still joins fully (no
  // worker is left running, no `remaining` count is stranded), the remaining indices
  // are drained without invoking fn, and the FIRST thrown exception is re-thrown from
  // parallel_for on the caller's thread. A throw thus propagates to the caller exactly
  // as a serial loop would, instead of escaping a worker thread (std::terminate) or
  // unwinding the caller past the still-running workers. Which index "wins" under
  // concurrent throws is unspecified; fn should not rely on all indices having run when
  // any throws.
