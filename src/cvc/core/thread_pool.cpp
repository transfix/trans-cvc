// thread_pool.cpp — see thread_pool.h.
//
// Sync model: workers park on _wake until _epoch advances (a job posted). Each
// participant (the caller and every enlisted worker) claims indices from the
// job's atomic cursor until it is drained, then decrements the job's `remaining`
// participant count with release semantics; the caller waits on _done for
// `remaining` to reach 0 (acquire), which establishes happens-before between the
// workers' writes and the caller's return. The job lives on the caller's stack:
// a worker only touches it between waking and its final decrement, and the caller
// clears _job only after `remaining` hits 0, so no worker races the stack unwind.
//
// There is ONE job slot, so `remaining` can only drain if every enlisted worker
// eventually wakes and adopts the job that is still in the slot. _post_mtx keeps
// that invariant across orchestrator threads: a caller holds it from posting its
// job until the job has drained and the slot is cleared, so a second concurrent
// parallel_for blocks rather than overwriting _job/_epoch out from under a
// slow-to-wake worker (which would strand the first caller in _done.wait), and a
// finishing caller's `_job = nullptr` can never stomp a freshly posted job.
